This Modification requires:
- 2x 608 bearings
- 2x m8 20-30mm bolts
- a length of metal rod (either 2.5mm^2 copper electrical wire, a Paperclip, or something similar)
Use the bottle cap for 12mm pipe from the main STL folder

Insert the metal rod through the four horizontal through-holes in the sliding gauge. These provide a durable bearing surface for the ribbon, replacing the two washers in the original Polycutter design.

A 15mm pipe version of the bottle holder and Cap can be found in the subfolder. A video demonstrating assembly and use of the original Polycutter is on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/EgzWEFJ99so).
